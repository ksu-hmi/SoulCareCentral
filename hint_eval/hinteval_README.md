# Hint App Evaluation

This folder contains the `Hint` macOS reminder application cloned from:

https://github.com/crsmithdev/hint

## Purpose

Evaluate the reminder functionality for potential integration into the Soulcare Solutions Central project.

## Summary

- Language: Swift / Objective-C
- Platform: macOS only (Xcode project)
- Uses system tray + notifications for mindfulness reminders
- Good inspiration for UI and periodic reminder logic

## Conclusion

Not directly reusable in Python, but very helpful for UI inspiration. We will explore cross-platform Python alternatives (like `plyer`, `notifiers`, or `schedule` libraries) for our own reminder module.
