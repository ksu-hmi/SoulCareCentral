## 📚 Findings from Related Projects
### 1. Hint (MacOS)
- Platform-specific but elegant reminders UI
- Possible inspiration for notification scheduling

### 2. Mindful Notifier
- Simple timer-based interface for focus sessions
- Lightweight and adaptable to different platforms

### 3. Box Breathing
- Very focused scope — strong breathing exercise logic

✅ Consider combining elements from Hint’s reminder UI and Box Breathing’s breathing control as modules.


## ✅ Evaluated Repository: Hint

**Repository:** [Hint – crsmithdev](https://github.com/crsmithdev/hint)

**Purpose:** Evaluate a macOS-based reminder system for potential use in the SoulCareCentral reminder feature.

**Findings:**
- Built with Swift and Objective-C for macOS only
- Uses Xcode storyboard for UI layout
- Implements periodic mindfulness break notifications in the system tray
- Simple, elegant concept that could inspire our cross-platform design

**Conclusion:**
The Hint repo is not directly portable to Python but offers excellent UX and timing logic inspiration. A cross-platform Python-based alternative will be explored for implementation.
