## üìö Findings from Related Projects
### 1. Hint (MacOS)
- Platform-specific but elegant reminders UI
- Possible inspiration for notification scheduling

### 2. Mindful Notifier
- Simple timer-based interface for focus sessions
- Lightweight and adaptable to different platforms

### 3. Box Breathing
- Very focused scope ‚Äî strong breathing exercise logic

‚úÖ Consider combining elements from Hint‚Äôs reminder UI and Box Breathing‚Äôs breathing control as modules.


## ‚úÖ Evaluated Repository: Hint

**Repository:** [Hint ‚Äì crsmithdev](https://github.com/crsmithdev/hint)

**Purpose:** Evaluate a macOS-based reminder system for potential use in the SoulCareCentral reminder feature.

**Findings:**
- Built with Swift and Objective-C for macOS only
- Uses Xcode storyboard for UI layout
- Implements periodic mindfulness break notifications in the system tray
- Simple, elegant concept that could inspire our cross-platform design

**Conclusion:**
The Hint repo is not directly portable to Python but offers excellent UX and timing logic inspiration. A cross-platform Python-based alternative will be explored for implementation.

## ‚úÖ Evaluated Repository: MindfulNotifier

**Repository:** [MindfulNotifier](https://github.com/kmac/mindfulnotifier)

**Purpose:** Investigate a potential Python-based reminder system for SoulCare Solutions Central.

**Findings:**
- Project is built using **Flutter** (not Python)
- Source code located in `lib/`, written in Dart
- Designed as a cross-platform **mobile app** (Android/iOS)
- Includes logic for notifications and mindfulness reminders

**Conclusion:**
The MindfulNotifier project is well-structured and offers good design inspiration for mobile reminders, but it is **not Python-based** and therefore not directly usable in SoulCare. We will explore other Python-native options such as `BreakTimer` or build a custom reminder tool using `Tkinter`, `plyer`, or `schedule`.


## ‚úÖ Evaluated Repository: Pomodoro-Timer (Python + Tkinter)

**Repository:** [https://github.com/Mahesh-Vard/Pomodoro-Timer](https://github.com/Mahesh-Vard/Pomodoro-Timer)

**Purpose:** Evaluate a simple, Python-based time management app for potential adaptation into SoulCare‚Äôs reminder feature.

**Findings:**
- Built with Python and Tkinter (GUI)
- Implements standard Pomodoro intervals (25 min work, 5 min break, 20 min long break)
- Runs successfully on macOS and shows a functioning GUI
- Well-structured and easy to modify

**Conclusion:**
This is a solid foundation to integrate SoulCare features like:
- Daily affirmations during breaks
- Mood journaling prompts after sessions
- Notification-style reminders to stretch, drink water, or breathe

‚úÖ Will move forward with customization for SoulCare Solutions Central.

## ‚úÖ Feature Added: Stretch Pose Visuals During Breaks

**Date Added:** April 19, 2025  
**Contributor:** Shanancy  

### Description:
Implemented random stretch pose visuals that appear during short and long breaks in the SoulCare Pomodoro Timer. The visuals are selected from a set of local image files in the `stretch_poses/` directory and displayed in the GUI using Tkinter.

### Features:
- Dynamically loads a new image each break session
- Integrates with existing reminder and sound features
- Designed for accessibility and relaxation

### Impact:
This feature boosts user engagement by encouraging physical movement alongside mental breaks, supporting SoulCare's holistic wellness goals.

### Next Steps:
- Include ‚ÄúSkip Pose‚Äù functionality
- Integrate Journal prompts for longer breaks
